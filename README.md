# PCB checklist

- Schematic
    - ERC
    - Components annotate
    - Position and labels of all controls match the schematic
    - Position and labels of all IO match the schematic
    - Indication match the IO and controls
    - All inputs more than 10k impedance
    - All outputs has 100 Ohm protection
    - Check BOM
        - remove pogopin, diodes, opamps
    - Backlight
- PCB
    - DRC
    - Check silkscreen
    - Check board outline
    - Name of the module, logo
    - link to site
    - version of the module
    - ±12, +5, GND marks
    - Sensitive circuits (high impedance, high frequency, opamp/power amp feedback)
    - Inverted soldermask under the silkscreen on indication windows
